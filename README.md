# Math.RandomGame
A JavaScript guessing game. 

This game asks a user for an integer input, 0-20, and then dynamically responds. 
The program uses the built-in Math.Random() Function to "think" of a number. 
It then uses If/Else statements to check if the user input was Greater Than or Less Than the Math.Random() Function. 
Based on its findings the program Dynamically renders the response it should display for othe user.
